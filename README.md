# GHZ-game
The GHZ-game is a fun game where three or more players can play together and to always win this game quantum strategy is needed. The details of this game is explained in brief in the jupyter [Notebook](https://github.com/shailendrabhandari/GHZ-game/blob/main/GHZ-Game.ipynb). Also, the details elaboration of classical and quantum mechanical concept of the game can be found in the attached [Project report](https://github.com/shailendrabhandari/GHZ-game/blob/main/Project_report.pdf). 



## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8 
* Qiskit version: 0.34.1



## Setup
This project use [Qiskit](qiskit.org). The best way of installing qiskit is by using pip: `$ pip install qiskit`. You can even try with the latest version of Qiskit too. 


## Executing  [GHZ_Game.ipynb](https://github.com/shailendrabhandari/GHZ-game/blob/main/GHZ-Game.ipynb) in IBM Quantum Lab

* Open IBM quantum lab [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
* Log in with the IBM account.
* Lunch IBM quantum lab.
* Open New file/Python 3(ipykernel)via Launcher.
* On the first cell enter ` !git clone https://github.com/shailendrabhandari/GHZ-game.git`.
* Execute the cell `Shift_enter` and then the GHZ_Game will be cloned in your IBM Quantum lab. 
* From the folder `GHZ_game` click `GHZ_Game.ipynb` and execute the cells to view and play the game.
